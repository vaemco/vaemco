### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

**Aspiring ML Engineer & Applied AI Researcher**

I am a self-taught developer exploring the exploring the intersection of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and applied research. My goal is to combine analytical rigor with modern machine learning techniques.

While I have built a solid conceptual understanding of ML architectures, I leverage modern tooling to accelerate experimentation, while focusing on understanding and implementing core ML concepts in depth. This allows me to dissect complex problems and learn the implementation details by doing.

### Focus & Learning

- **Data Science:** Analyzing complex datasets and finding patterns using statistical methods.
- **Machine Learning:** Studying the internal mechanics of Neural Networks and Deep Learning architectures.
- **Methodology:** Moving from theoretical understanding to writing efficient algorithms from scratch.

### Current Projects

- **Medical Image Classification:** Developing a Brain Tumor Detection model using PyTorch with a focus on Explainable AI (XAI).

### Background

Outside of code, I am a **Windsurf Photographer**. Dealing with thousands of high-speed action shots has sparked my deep interest in Computer Vision and efficient Data Management. I view photography as a data source that is waiting to be analyzed and organized by intelligent systems.

### Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) • PyTorch • Docker • Git
